    <h2>Lost Artists Feature</h2>
    <p>Introducing our lost artists feature where we are bringing light to unknown artists who never had a light to shine — until now, thanks to our technology helping artists with little industry backing get exposure.</p>
    It’s important to recognize the market opportunity in elevating unknown artists to the surface of mainstream. While celebrating the success of big artists like Beyonce, Taylor Swift, and Kendrick Lamar it’s also important to recognize they started somewhere. Introducing the feature for unknown artists being brought to light is an early opportunity for fan bases to be developed. Additionally, shareholders should also establish strategic partnerships with record labels. This opportunity gives artists for bigger budget production and the platform to be a rising global superstar.
Our Goals:
Enable Bigger Budget Production:
 Provide rising artists with access to resources typically reserved for established stars, including high-quality recording studios, professional production teams, and marketing support. This helps them create polished, competitive music that can reach mainstream audiences.


Deepen Industry Partnerships:
 Collaborate strategically with record labels, talent agencies, and industry stakeholders. These partnerships give artists mentorship, promotional support, and access to networks that accelerate their growth and visibility.


Expand Opportunities Beyond Music:
 Support artists in pursuing brand partnerships, sponsorships, and other commercial opportunities that can supplement their revenue and elevate their public profile. By creating multi-dimensional career pathways, the platform positions artists as rising global superstars.

    <h2>Shareholders</h2>


    <p>Why is this feature important to Shareholders?:
	1. It creates a competitive advantage.
Platforms that help discover new talent stand out in a crowded market. Most platforms highlight already-famous artists; showcasing emerging artists positions your platform as a trendsetter that shapes culture rather than simply reflecting it.
2. It builds long-term user engagement.
Fans love discovering artists “before they blow up.” When users feel like they’re part of an artist’s early journey, they are more likely to stay loyal to the platform that introduced them.
3. It grows the next generation of superstars.
Every superstar began as an unknown. By investing early in emerging talent, the platform helps cultivate the next Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, or Kendrick Lamar. If those artists rise to fame, the platform can take partial credit for their discovery—boosting brand reputation.
